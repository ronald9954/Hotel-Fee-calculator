# Hotel-Fee-calculator
Hotel Fee calculator for a Japanese hotel. Each day's price is different so a specific calculator is required.

A hotel uses a very specific kind of fee calculation where every day's hotel fee is different.
To streamline the calculation process, I made a calculator to help with simplifying the steps.
The user only need to input the day type of the involved dates for calculations, instead of inputting the exact amount every time.
